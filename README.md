**Following is what you need for this book:**

State management, a crucial aspect of the React ecosystem, has gained significant attention in recent times. While React offers various libraries and tools to handle state, each with different approaches and perspectives, one thing is clear: state management solutions for handling client state are not optimized for dealing with server state. React Query was created to address this issue of managing your server state, and this guide will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively use React Query for state management.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).
